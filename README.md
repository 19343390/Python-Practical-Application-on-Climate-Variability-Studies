# Python & Practical Application on Climate Variability Studies
Main objective of this tutorial is the transference of know-how in practical applications and management of statistical tools commonly used to explore meteorological time series, focusing on applications to study issues related with the climate variability and climate change. This tutorial starts with some basic statistic for time series analysis as estimation of means, anomalies, standard deviation, correlations, arriving the estimation of particular climate indexes (Ni√±o 3), detrending single time series and decomposition of time series, filtering, interpolation of climate variables on regular or irregular grids, leading modes of climate variability (EOF or HHT), signal processing in the climate system (spectral and wavelet analysis). In addition, this tutorial also deals with different data formats such as CSV, NetCDF, Binary, and matlab'mat, etc. It is assumed that you have basic knowledge and understanding of statistics and Python.
